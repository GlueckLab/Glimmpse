solvingForDescription = To begin your calculation, please indicate whether you would like to solve for power or total sample size. \
<p> \
If you have a rough idea of the number of subjects you will be able to recruit, then solving for power may be more beneficial. <p>\

is likely to be more useful.

that will be observed in your study. <p></p>You will be asked to enter the names of your \
outcomes, and indicate whether the measurements were repeated on individual \
subjects.
# outcomes panel

over multiple days)

# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Study Groups
predictorsDescription = Here you will specify the characteristics of subjects in your study.  This will help define the \
groups involved in your study.
categoricalTitle = Categorical Predictors
categoricalDescription = In the table below, specify any categorical predictors.  Categorical predictors take on \
a set number of possible values (i.e. categories).  A common example of a categorical predictor is treatment group, \
where research participants may be randomized to a placebo or an active drug group.  \
 <p> \
 Enter the names of all categorical predictors in the left text box.  For example, one might enter "drug" and "gender" as predictors. \
 </p><p> \
For each predictor, highlight the predictor name from the list on the left below the "Predictor" text box, \
and type its associated category names in the "Categories" text box.<p> \
For the example above, you would highlight "drug", then enter "placebo" and "active" as categories.  Next, you would \
highlight "gender" and type "male" and "female" as categories.
covariateTitle = Controlling for a Single Continuous Predictor or a Baseline Covariate
covariateDescription = A common experimental design is analysis of covariance.  Analysis of covariance typically has \
several categorical predictors that are fixed by the design.  For example, one might run an experiment with 10 males and \
10 females, with an indicator variable for gender as a categorical predictor.  In addition, the design typically includes \
a single continuous predictor.  \
<p> \
A common special case of analysis of covariance is the baseline covariate design.  In this design, a series of repeated measurements \
on a continuous outcome are recorded.  The first one is measured at the start of the experiment and is commonly called the \
baseline covariate.  The other repeated measurements are used as outcome in the general linear multivariate model.  The rationale \
for using a baseline covariate, is that the covariate explains a large proportion of the variance of outcomes, thus increasing the \
power for the hypotheses of interest which typically concern the categorical predictors such as "gender".\
<p>\
The GLIMMPSE program allows you to calculate power for hypotheses concerning the categorical predictors, \
optionally controlling for a single continuous and normally distributed predictor.  If you plan to include a single \
continuous predictor in your model, click the check box below.\
<p> \
At present, the GLIMMPSE software does not calculate power for multiple continuous predictors nor non-normally \
distributed predictors.
predictorsTableColumn = Characteristic
categoriesTableColumn = Categories

predictorsCovariateDescription = Finally, you can control for a subject characteristic which does not have a predefined set of \
values, also known as a baseline covariate.  This could includes values such as age, height, systolic blood pressure, etc.  \
To control for a baseline covariate, name your covariate below.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal distribution, \
so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.
matrixCovariateDescription = You may control for a single baseline covariate by clicking the checkbox below, \
and specifying a mean and standard deviation for the variable.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal \
distribution
covariateCheckBoxLabel = Control for a single continous predictor
covariateMeanLabel = Mean
covariateStandardDeviationLabel = Standard Deviation


# study groups panel

studyGroupsDescription = On this panel, you will specify the relative and actual sizes of your study groups.
perGroupSampleSizeTitle = Per Group Sample Sizes
perGroupSampleSizeDescription = Now that you have specified the ratio of group sizes, you will need to specify \
the actual number of study participants you plan to recruit.  If your group sizes are equal, specify the number of \
study participants within each group.  For unequal group sizes, specify the number of study participants in the smallest group. \
<p> \
In many cases, the per group sample size may be fixed.  For example, you may only have 6 recombinant mice \
and 6 control mice.  However, researchers may not be certain ahead of time how many study participants they \
will be able to recruit.  A reasonable approach is to calculate power for several different per group sample sizes. \
It is generally useful to calculate power for the expected per group sample size, half the expected per group sample size, \
 and twice the expected per group sample size.  Therefore, the list below allows you to enter mutliple values for your \
 per group sample size. \
<p> \
Enter the group sizes in the text box below and click enter.  To \
remove a group size from the list, highlight it and click the "Delete" button.
perGroupSampleSizeTableColumn = Per Group Sample Size
equalGroupsLabel = Use equal group sizes

For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study group.  This is the default study design. \
<p> \
For unequal group sizes, you will specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, you would select "2" for the placebo group, and "1" for the active drug group.
relativeGroupSizeTableColumn = Relative<br>Group Size
