startTitle = Start Your Study Design
startDescription = To begin your power or sample size estimate, you will need to specify \
 a study design. Glimmpse offers two modes for entering the study design.  Guided mode \
provides visual and textual guidance for estimating study design components such as \
effect size and variability.  Statisticians and other advanced users may prefer the Matrix mode \
which allows you to directly enter matrices required for power and sample size calculations.\
In addition, you may upload study designs previously saved from Glimmpse.
startMatrixTitle = Matrix Study Design
startMatrixDescription = Directly enter the matrices for the general linear model.  For users \
who are more familiar with statistical methods and the general linear model.
startGuidedTitle = Guided Study Design
startGuidedDescription = Build common study designs including ANOVA, ANCOVA, and \
regression with guidance from the study design wizard. For users less familiar with the \
general linear model
startUploadTitle = Upload an Existing Study Design
startUploadDescription = If you have previously saved a study design from Glimmpse, \
you may upload it here. Click browse to select your study design file.

# alpha panel
alphaTitle = Type I Error
alphaDescription = Enter the type I error value(s) you would like to include in your \
calculations.  Type I error indicates the probability of incorrectly identifying a significant difference \
when there is none (i.e. rejecting a true null hypothesis).  Type I error values should \
be decimals between 0 and 1.  The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and \
0.1.
alphaTableColumn = Type I Error Values
# outcomes panel
outcomesTitle = Outcome Variables
outcomesDescription = Please enter your outcome variables in the table below.  \
Outcomes are the dependent variables in your study.  For example, in a study investigating \
cholesterol-lowering medication, the outcome could be serum cholesterol levels.
outcomesLabelRepeated = Number of measurement repetitions: 
outcomesTableColumn = Outcomes
repeatedMeasuresTitle =Repeated Measures
repeatedMeasuresDescription = If the same measurement is repeated for each subject, enter \
the conditions over which the measurement was repeated.  For example, suppose systolic \
blood presure (SBP) is measured at weeks 1, 2, and 3 after starting an exercise program.  "SBP" \
would be listed in the outcomes table above, and "week" with 3 repetitions would be entered \
in the repeated measures table.  If the study took 2  SBP measurements at each week, you \
could add an additional repeated measures variables "beforeAfter" with 2 repeptitions. \
If your study does not involve repeated measurements, leave the table below blank.
repeatedOverTableColumn = Repeated Over
repetitionsTableColumn = # Repetitions

# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Predictors
predictorsDescription = Predictors are the independent variables in your study.  Fixed predictors and \
all possible values should be entered in the table below.  Fixed predictors have categorical values which are established as part of the \
study design (ex. Treatments A, B, and C, or genders male and female).  
predictorsTableColumn = Predictor
