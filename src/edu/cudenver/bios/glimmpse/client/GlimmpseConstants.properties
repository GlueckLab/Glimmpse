solvingForDescription = To begin your calculation, please indicate whether you would like to solve for power or total sample size. \
<p> \
If you have a rough idea of the number of subjects you will be able to recruit, then solving for power may be more beneficial. <p>\
If you have fewer restrictions on recruitment and would like to ensure a well-powered study, then solving for sample size \
is likely to be more useful.

Click next to specify your study design.


### Outcomes group ###
outcomesIntroTitle = Outcomes - Introduction
outcomesIntroDescription = Outcomes, or dependent variables, are the measurements  \
that will be observed in your study. <p></p>You will be asked to enter the names of your \
outcomes, and indicate whether the measurements were repeated on individual \
subjects.
# outcomes panel

repeatedMeasures2DLabel = Yes, measurements were repeated over two dimensions (ex. over weeks, and within each week \
over multiple days)
repeatedMeasuresRepeatsLabel = How many times?
repeatedMeasuresUnitsLabel = Over what dimension?
# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Study Groups
predictorsDescription = Here you will specify the characteristics of subjects in your study.  This will help define the \
groups involved in your study.
categoricalTitle = Categorical Predictors
categoricalDescription = In the table below, specify any categorical predictors.  Categorical predictors take on \
a set number of possible values (i.e. categories).  A common example of a categorical predictor is treatment group, \
where research participants may be randomized to a placebo or an active drug group.  \
 <p> \
 Enter the names of all categorical predictors in the left text box.  For example, one might enter "drug" and "gender" as predictors. \
 </p><p> \
For each predictor, highlight the predictor name from the list on the left below the "Predictor" text box, \
and type its associated category names in the "Categories" text box.<p> \
For the example above, you would highlight "drug", then enter "placebo" and "active" as categories.  Next, you would \
highlight "gender" and type "male" and "female" as categories.
covariateTitle = Controlling for a Single Continuous Predictor or a Baseline Covariate
covariateDescription = A common experimental design is analysis of covariance.  Analysis of covariance typically has \
several categorical predictors that are fixed by the design.  For example, one might run an experiment with 10 males and \
10 females, with an indicator variable for gender as a categorical predictor.  In addition, the design typically includes \
a single continuous predictor.  \
<p> \
A common special case of analysis of covariance is the baseline covariate design.  In this design, a series of repeated measurements \
on a continuous outcome are recorded.  The first one is measured at the start of the experiment and is commonly called the \
baseline covariate.  The other repeated measurements are used as outcome in the general linear multivariate model.  The rationale \
for using a baseline covariate, is that the covariate explains a large proportion of the variance of outcomes, thus increasing the \
power for the hypotheses of interest which typically concern the categorical predictors such as "gender".\
<p>\
The GLIMMPSE program allows you to calculate power for hypotheses concerning the categorical predictors, \
optionally controlling for a single continuous and normally distributed predictor.  If you plan to include a single \
continuous predictor in your model, click the check box below.\
<p> \
At present, the GLIMMPSE software does not calculate power for multiple continuous predictors nor non-normally \
distributed predictors.
predictorsTableColumn = Predictor
categoriesTableColumn = Category

predictorsCovariateDescription = Finally, you can control for a subject characteristic which does not have a predefined set of \
values, also known as a baseline covariate.  This could includes values such as age, height, systolic blood pressure, etc.  \
To control for a baseline covariate, name your covariate below.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal distribution, \
so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.
matrixCovariateDescription = You may control for a single baseline covariate by clicking the checkbox below, \
and specifying a mean and standard deviation for the variable.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal \
distribution
covariateCheckBoxLabel = Control for a single continous predictor
covariateMeanLabel = Mean

perGroupSampleSizeTitle = Per Group Sample Sizes
perGroupSampleSizeDescription = Enter the number of participants you intend to recruit for each group in your study. \
If your group sizes are equal, specify the number of study participants within each group.  For unequal group sizes, \
specify the number of study participants in the smallest group. \
<p> \
In many cases, it is not possible to know the exact number of participants that will be recruited for a study. \
Therefore, you may calculate power for several possible values for the per group sample size.  If you are unsure of \
the exact number of participants in each group, a reasonable approach would be calculate power for your target \
per group sample size, as well as half and twice that value. \
<p> \
Enter the per group sample sizes in the text box below and click enter.  To \
remove a per group sample size from the list, highlight it and click the "Delete" button.
perGroupSampleSizeTableColumn = Per Group Sample Size
equalGroupsLabel = Use equal group sizes

For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study group.  This is the default study design. \
<p> \
For unequal group sizes, you will specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, you would select "2" for the placebo group, and "1" for the active drug group.
relativeGroupSizeTableColumn = Relative<br>Group Size

meanDifferenceInteractionEffectQuestion = An interaction effect is a "difference of differences," which measures how much the effect of \
one factors changes based on levels of a second factor.  For example, if a hypertension medication lowers systolic blood pressure by \
20 mmHg in males, but only 5 mmHg in females when compared against a placebo group, then the magnitude of the interaction \
effect would be 15 mmHg.  <p></p>In the text boxes below, enter the minimum "difference of differences" you would like to be able to detect \
for each of your outcomes.  That is, enter the amount by which you expect the effect of

# design matrix panel
matrixDesignTitle = The Design Essence Matrix
matrixDesignDescription = In the general linear model, <i><b>Y</b> = <b>XB</b> + <b>E</b></i>, the <b>X</b> matrix contains \
predictor and covariate information.  For power analysis, you will need to specify a design essence matrix, Es(<b>X</b>).  \
The Es(<b>X</b>) is a simplified design matrix containing a single row for each unique row in the full design matrix.  This \
separates the study design information from the sample size.<p></p>\
Enter your Es(<b>X</b>) matrix below.  To change the dimensions of this matrix, enter updated row or column values in the textboxes \
located above the matrix data.  Please use a <u>full rank coding</u> for this matrix.<p></p>

# beta matrix screens
betaTitle = Regression Coefficients: B Matrix
betaDescription = The <b>B</b> matrix contains regression coefficients.  For power analysis, you will need to provide the \
values you expect to see for these coefficients.  These values are often determined from pilot data or previous studies.<p></p> \
The number of columns in <b>B</b> indicates the number of outcomes in your study (i.e. the number of columns in <b>Y</b>).  \
To adjust the number of outcomes in your study, change the column dimension in the textbox above the matrix data. \
The number of rows in <b>B</b> must equal the number of columns in Es(<b>X</b>), so it cannot be adjusted on this screen.<p></p> \
Enter values for the regression coefficients in the matrix below.
betaScaleTitle = Scale Factors for Regression Coefficients
betaScaleDescription = In power analysis, it is not possible to know the exact values of regression coefficients beforehand. \
Scale factors allow you to consider alternative values for the regression coefficients by scaling the <b>B</b> matrix.  \
For example, entering the scale factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute power for the regression coefficients as entered, \
as well as half and twice the specified values. <p></p> \
In the list below, enter scale factors for your regression coefficients. To use the <b>B</b> matrix exactly as specified \
on the previous screen, enter a "1" in the list below.

betaGaussianMatrixName = &beta; Gaussian

# sigma matrix screens
sigmaScaleTitle = Scale Factors for  Covariance
sigmaScaleDescription = Changes in variability can dramatically effect your power estimates.  Since it is not typically \
possible to know covariance values beforehand, scale factors allow you to compute power for alternative covariance values \
by scaling <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub>.  For example, entering the scale factors 0.5, 1, and 2 would compute  \
power for the covariance matrix as entered, as well as half and twice the specified values. <p></p> \
In the list below, enter scale factors for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub>. To use the <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> \

# contrasts
betweenSubjectContrastTitle = Between Subject Contrast: C Matrix
betweenSubjectContrastDescription = The <b>C</b> matrix defines the contrasts you would \
like to test for between subject effects. The number of rows in the <b>C</b> matrix cannot exceed one less than \
the number rows in Es(<b>X</b>).  In addition, the number of columns in <b>C</b> must equal the \
number of columns in <b>B</b>, so the columns of <b>C</b> cannot be adjusted on this screen. <p></p> \
Enter your between subject contrast matrix below.
betweenSubjectContrastMatrixName = <b>C</b> Matrix
withinSubjectContrastTitle = Within Subject Contrast: U Matrix
withinSubjectContrastDescription = The <b>U</b> matrix defines the contrasts you would \
like to test for within subject effects.  This matrix is most useful for multivariate and repeated measures designs. \
The number of rows in <b>U</b> must equal the number of columns in <b>B</b>, so the row dimension of \
<b>U</b> cannot be adjusted on this screen.<p></p>\
Enter your within subject contrast matrix below.
withinSubjectContrastMatrixName = <b>U</b> Matrix

# theta null
thetaNullTitle = Null Hypotheses: &Theta;<sub>0</sub> Matrix
thetaNullDescription = The <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub></b> matrix contains the test values you would expect \
to observe when the null hypothesis is true.  <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub></b> is compared against the \
observed <b>&Theta;</b> =  <b>CBU</b>, and the general linear hypothesis is stated as <p></p> \
H<sub>0</sub> : <b>&Theta;</b> =  <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub> <p></p> \
In most cases, <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub> will be a matrix of zeros.  The number of rows in <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub> must \
equal the number of rows in <b>C</b>, and the number of columns must match the number of columns in <b>U</b>.  \
Therefore, the dimensions of <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub> cannot be adjusted on this screen <p></p> Enter your <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub> matrix below.
thetaNullMatrixName = <b>&Theta;</b><sub>0</sub> Matrix

# covariance matrices
sigmaErrorTitle = Covariance of Errors: &Sigma;<sub>E</sub> Matrix
sigmaErrorDescription = For each independent sampling unit, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> defines the covariance of the \
residual errors. For univariate designs, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the variance of the error term.  \
More complex structures, such as compound symmetry or auto-regressive structures may be entered for \
multivariate or repeated measures designs.  In both cases, <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> is a square, symmetric \
matrix with dimension equal to the number of columns in <b>B</b>. \
For power analysis, you must provide your best guess for the covariance values.  \
Values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> are typically obtained from pilot data or previous studies. <p></p>\
Enter your speculated values for <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> in matrix below.
sigmaErrorMatrixName = <b>&Sigma;</b><sub>E</sub> Matrix
sigmaCovariateTitle = Variance of the Baseline Covariate: &Sigma;<sub>G</sub>
sigmaCovariateDescription = Since your study design includes a baseline covariate, you will need to estimate the \
distribution of the covariate.  The covariate is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and covariance, \
&Sigma;<sub>G</sub>, specified below.  Note that GLIMMPSE only allows adjustment for a single Gaussian predictor, \
so the covariance matrix is 1x1 and contains the variance of the covariate. <p></p> \
Enter the variance of your covariate in the matrix below. 
sigmaCovariateMatrixName = &Sigma;<sub>G</sub> Matrix
sigmaOutcomeTitle = Covariance of Outcomes: &Sigma;<sub>Y</sub>
sigmaOutcomeDescription = The outcomes covariance matrix, &Sigma;<sub>Y</sub>, defines the covariance structure \
for outcomes within each subject.  For univariate designs, this matrix will be 1x1 and contain the estimated variance of the \
outcome.  More complex structures, such as compound symmetry or auto-regressive structures may be required for \
multivariate or repeated measures designs.  <p></p> Please enter your estimated outcome covariance matrix below.
sigmaOutcomeMatrixName = &Sigma;<sub>Y</sub> Matrix
sigmaOutcomeCovariateTitle = Covariance of Outcomes with Covariate: &Sigma;<sub>YG</sub>
sigmaOutcomeCovariateDescription = When controlling for a covariate, power is typically improved when the covariate \
explains some portion of the variance in the outcome.  The covariance matrix between the outcomes and \
covariate, &Sigma;<sub>YG</sub>, allows you to specify the estimated association between the covariate and the \
outcomes.  For univariate designs, this matrix will be 1x1 and contain the covariance between the outcome and covariate. \
For multivariate and repeated measures designs, the matrix will be px1, where p is the number of outcomes, and each row \
will contain the covariance between the covariate and the corresponding outcome. <p></p> Please enter your \
