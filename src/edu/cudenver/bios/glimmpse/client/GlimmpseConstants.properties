solvingForDescription = To begin your calculation, please indicate whether you would like to solve for power or total sample size. \
<p> \
If you have a rough idea of the number of subjects you will be able to recruit, then solving for power may be more beneficial. <p>\
If you have fewer restrictions on recruitment and would like to ensure a well-powered study, then solving for sample size \
is likely to be more useful.
solvingForPowerLabel = Power
solvingForSampleSizeLabel = Total Sample Size
solvingForEffectSizeLabel = Effect Size
solvingForNominalPowerTitle = Power Values
solvingForNominalPowerDescription = Enter the desired power values in the list below. \
 Power values are decimals between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating a greater likelihood of correctly rejecting \
 your null hypothesis.  Common  values are 0.8 or 0.9.  <p>Type the decimal into the listbox and click enter.  To remove \
 an item, highlight it and click the "Delete" button

Click next to specify your study design.


### Outcomes group ###
outcomesIntroTitle = Outcomes - Introduction
outcomesIntroDescription = Outcomes, or dependent variables, are the measurements  \
that will be observed in your study. <p></p>You will be asked to enter the names of your \
outcomes, and indicate whether the measurements were repeated on individual \
subjects.
# outcomes panel

# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Study Groups
predictorsDescription = Here you will specify the characteristics of subjects in your study.  This will help define the \
groups involved in your study.
categoricalTitle = Categorical Predictors
categoricalDescription = In the table below, specify any categorical predictors.  Categorical predictors take on \
a set number of possible values (i.e. categories).  A common example of a categorical predictor is treatment group, \
where research participants may be randomized to a placebo or an active drug group.  \
 <p> \
 Enter the names of all categorical predictors in the left text box.  For example, one might enter "drug" and "gender" as predictors. \
 </p><p> \
For each predictor, highlight the predictor name from the list on the left below the "Predictor" text box, \
and type its associated category names in the "Categories" text box.<p> \
For the example above, you would highlight "drug", then enter "placebo" and "active" as categories.  Next, you would \
highlight "gender" and type "male" and "female" as categories.
covariateTitle = Controlling for a Single Continuous Predictor or a Baseline Covariate
covariateDescription = A common experimental design is analysis of covariance.  Analysis of covariance typically has \
several categorical predictors that are fixed by the design.  For example, one might run an experiment with 10 males and \
10 females, with an indicator variable for gender as a categorical predictor.  In addition, the design typically includes \
a single continuous predictor.  \
<p> \
A common special case of analysis of covariance is the baseline covariate design.  In this design, a series of repeated measurements \
on a continuous outcome are recorded.  The first one is measured at the start of the experiment and is commonly called the \
baseline covariate.  The other repeated measurements are used as outcome in the general linear multivariate model.  The rationale \
for using a baseline covariate, is that the covariate explains a large proportion of the variance of outcomes, thus increasing the \
power for the hypotheses of interest which typically concern the categorical predictors such as "gender".\
<p>\
The GLIMMPSE program allows you to calculate power for hypotheses concerning the categorical predictors, \
optionally controlling for a single continuous and normally distributed predictor.  If you plan to include a single \
continuous predictor in your model, click the check box below.\
<p> \
At present, the GLIMMPSE software does not calculate power for multiple continuous predictors nor non-normally \
distributed predictors.
predictorsTableColumn = Predictor
categoriesTableColumn = Category

predictorsCovariateDescription = Finally, you can control for a subject characteristic which does not have a predefined set of \
values, also known as a baseline covariate.  This could includes values such as age, height, systolic blood pressure, etc.  \
To control for a baseline covariate, name your covariate below.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal distribution, \
so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.
matrixCovariateDescription = You may control for a single baseline covariate by clicking the checkbox below, \
and specifying a mean and standard deviation for the variable.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal \
distribution
covariateCheckBoxLabel = Control for a single continous predictor
covariateMeanLabel = Mean
covariateStandardDeviationLabel = Standard Deviation


# study groups panel
studyGroupsTitle = Group Sizes
studyGroupsDescription = On this panel, you will specify the relative and actual sizes of your study groups.
perGroupSampleSizeTitle = Per Group Sample Sizes
perGroupSampleSizeDescription = Now that you have specified the ratio of group sizes, you will need to specify \
the actual number of study participants you plan to recruit.  If your group sizes are equal, specify the number of \
study participants within each group.  For unequal group sizes, specify the number of study participants in the smallest group. \
<p> \
In many cases, the per group sample size may be fixed.  For example, you may only have 6 recombinant mice \
and 6 control mice.  However, researchers may not be certain ahead of time how many study participants they \
will be able to recruit.  A reasonable approach is to calculate power for several different per group sample sizes. \
It is generally useful to calculate power for the expected per group sample size, half the expected per group sample size, \
 and twice the expected per group sample size.  Therefore, the list below allows you to enter mutliple values for your \
 per group sample size. \
<p> \
Enter the group sizes in the text box below and click enter.  To \
remove a group size from the list, highlight it and click the "Delete" button.
perGroupSampleSizeTableColumn = Per Group Sample Size

For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study group.  This is the default study design. \
<p> \
For unequal group sizes, you will specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, you would select "2" for the placebo group, and "1" for the active drug group.
relativeGroupSizeTableColumn = Relative<br>Group Size

meanDifferenceInteractionEffectHypothesis = You've selected a primary hypothesis which examines the interaction effect between 
meanDifferenceInteractionEffectQuestion = An interaction effect is a "difference of differences," which measures how much the effect of \
one factors changes based on levels of a second factor.  For example, if a hypertension medication lowers systolic blood pressure by \
20 mmHg in males, but only 5 mmHg in females when compared against a placebo group, then the magnitude of the interaction \
effect would be 15 mmHg.  <p></p>In the text boxes below, enter the minimum "difference of differences" you would like to be able to detect \
for each of your outcomes.  That is, enter the amount by which you expect the effect of

Click next to begin.
# design matrix panel
matrixDesignTitle = Study Design: X "Essence" Matrix
matrixDesignDescription = In the standard regression equation Y = X&beta; + &epsilon;, the X matrix represents the \
study design.  Since power analysis does not include actual data, the X "essence" matrix is a simplified design matrix \
with a single row for each unique row in the full design matrix.  Note that this matrix represents only categorical predictors. \
Enter your design in the matrix below, using the textboxes \
to resize as needed.  Please use a <u>full rank coding</u> for this matrix.<p></p> \
In addition, the "Relative Group Size" list boxes allow you to specify the relative sizes of your study groups.  Each row of \
your X "essence" matrix refers to a unique subgroup of research participants.  If each subgroup contains an equal number \
of research participants, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study group.  This is the default study design. \
For unequal group sizes, you will specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, you would select "2" for the design matrix row corresponding to the placebo group, \
and "1" for the active drug group.
matrixCategoricalEffectsLabel = Categorical Predictors
matrixCovariateEffectsLabel = Covariate

# beta matrix screens
betaTitle = Estimated Regression Coefficients: &beta; Matrix
betaDescription = The &beta; matrix includes estimates for your regression coefficients.  The number of columns \
corresponds to the number of outcomes in your study (i.e. the number of columns in Y).  Note that the row dimension \
of the &beta; matrix must conform with your X matrix, so it cannot be adjusted on this screen.  <p></p> \
Enter your estimated regression coefficients in the matrix below, using the column text box to adjust the number of \
outcomes in your study.
betaScaleTitle = Flexible Regression Coefficient Estimates
betaScaleDescription = Since power is based on estimated regression coefficients, it is common to calculate \
power for the estimated value, as well as alternative values such as half and twice the estimated value.  In the list below, \
you may specify scale factors for your &beta; matrix to include in your power calculation.  For example, to calculate power \
for regression coefficients which are half the values in your &beta; matrix, enter "0.5" in the list below.  To use the exact \
&beta matrix you specified, enter a "1" in the list below.
betaScaleTableColumn = &beta; Matrix Scale Factors
betaFixedMatrixName = &beta; Categorical
betaGaussianMatrixName = &beta; Gaussian

# sigma matrix screens

sigmaScaleDescription = Changes in variability can dramatically effect your power estimates.  Therefore, it is common to \
estimate power for alternative covariance values, such as half or twice the variability.  In the list below, \
you may specify scale factors for your covariance estimates to include in your power calculations.  For example, \
to calculate power for covariance values which are half the values in your &Sigma; matrices, enter "0.5" in the list below.  \
To use the exact covariance values you specified on the previous screens, enter a "1" in the list below.
sigmaScaleTableColumn = Covariance Scale Factors

# contrasts

betweenSubjectContrastDescription = The between subject contrast matrix defines the hypotheses / contrasts you would \
like to test for between subject effects.  The number of rows in the C matrix reflects the degrees of freedom for the \
hypothesis test.  Note that the number of rows in the C matrix cannot exceed the number rows in the X "essence" matrix \
minus 1.  In addition, the C matrix must conform to the &beta; matrix, so the number of columns cannot be adjusted \
on this screen. <p></p> \
Enter your between subject contrast matrix below, using the row text box to adjust the degrees of freedom as needed.
betweenSubjectContrastMatrixName = C Matrix
withinSubjectContrastTitle = Within Subject Contrast Matrix: U
withinSubjectContrastDescription = The within subject contrast matrix defines the hypotheses / contrasts you would \
like to test for within subject effects.  This matrix is most useful for multivariate designs and repeated measures. \
Note that the U matrix must conform to the &beta; matrix, so the number of rows is not adjustable on this screen.<p></p>\
Enter your within subject contrast matrix below, using the column text box to adjust the dimensions as needed.
withinSubjectContrastMatrixName = U Matrix

# theta null
thetaNullTitle = Null Hypotheses: &Theta;<sub>0</sub>
thetaNullDescription = The null hypothesis matrix, &Theta;<sub>0</sub>, represents the test values you would expect \
to observe when the null hypothesis is true.  When performing power analysis, the estimated values for your hypothesis tests \
would be calculated as &Theta; = C&beta;U, and then compared against the &Theta;<sub>0</sub> you specify below. \
Note that &Theta;<sub>0</sub> has the same number of rows as C, and the same number of columns of U.  \
Therefore, it's size cannot be adjusted on this screen <p></p> Enter your &Theta;<sub>0</sub> matrix below.
thetaNullMatrixName = &Theta;<sub>0</sub> Matrix

for regression errors in the standard regression equation Y = X&beta; + &epsilon;.  For univariate designs, this matrix will \
be 1x1 and contain the estimated variance of the error term.  More complex structures, such as compound symmetry \
or auto-regressive structures may be required for multivariate or repeated measures designs.  <p></p> \
Please enter your estimated error covariance matrix below.
sigmaErrorMatrixName = &Sigma;<sub>&epsilon;</sub> Matrix
sigmaCovariateTitle = Variance of the Baseline Covariate: &Sigma;<sub>G</sub>
sigmaCovariateDescription = Since your study design includes a baseline covariate, you will need to estimate the \
distribution of the covariate.  The covariate is assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and covariance, \
&Sigma;<sub>G</sub>, specified below.  Note that GLIMMPSE only allows adjustment for a single Gaussian predictor, \
so the covariance matrix is 1x1 and contains the variance of the covariate. <p></p> \
Enter the variance of your covariate in the matrix below. 
sigmaCovariateMatrixName = &Sigma;<sub>G</sub> Matrix
sigmaOutcomeTitle = Covariance of Outcomes: &Sigma;<sub>Y</sub>
sigmaOutcomeDescription = The outcomes covariance matrix, &Sigma;<sub>Y</sub>, defines the covariance structure \
for outcomes within each subject.  For univariate designs, this matrix will be 1x1 and contain the estimated variance of the \
outcome.  More complex structures, such as compound symmetry or auto-regressive structures may be required for \
multivariate or repeated measures designs.  <p></p> Please enter your estimated outcome covariance matrix below.
sigmaOutcomeMatrixName = &Sigma;<sub>Y</sub> Matrix
sigmaOutcomeCovariateTitle = Covariance of Outcomes with Covariate: &Sigma;<sub>YG</sub>
sigmaOutcomeCovariateDescription = When controlling for a covariate, power is typically improved when the covariate \
explains some portion of the variance in the outcome.  The covariance matrix between the outcomes and \
covariate, &Sigma;<sub>YG</sub>, allows you to specify the estimated association between the covariate and the \
outcomes.  For univariate designs, this matrix will be 1x1 and contain the covariance between the outcome and covariate. \
For multivariate and repeated measures designs, the matrix will be px1, where p is the number of outcomes, and each row \
will contain the covariance between the covariate and the corresponding outcome. <p></p> Please enter your \
