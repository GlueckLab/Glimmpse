startTitle = Start Your Study Design
startDescription = To begin your power or sample size estimate, you will need to specify \
 a study design. Glimmpse offers two modes for entering the study design.  Guided mode \
provides visual and textual guidance for estimating study design components such as \
effect size and variability.  Statisticians and other advanced users may prefer the Matrix mode \
which allows you to directly enter matrices required for power and sample size calculations.\
In addition, you may upload study designs previously saved from Glimmpse.
startMatrixTitle = Matrix Study Design
startMatrixDescription = Directly enter the matrices for the general linear model.  For users \
who are more familiar with statistical methods and the general linear model.
startGuidedTitle = Guided Study Design
startGuidedDescription = Build common study designs including ANOVA, ANCOVA, and \
regression with guidance from the study design wizard. For users less familiar with the \
general linear model
startUploadTitle = Upload an Existing Study Design
startUploadDescription = If you have previously saved a study design from Glimmpse, \
you may upload it here. Click browse to select your study design file.

# alpha panel
alphaTitle = Type I Error
alphaDescription = Enter the type I error value(s) you would like to include in your \
calculations.  Type I error indicates the probability of incorrectly identifying a significant difference \
when there is none (i.e. rejecting a true null hypothesis).  Type I error values should \
be decimals between 0 and 1.  The most commonly used values are 0.01, 0.05, and \
0.1.
alphaTableTitle = Type I Error Values
# outcomes panel
outcomesTitle = Outcome Variables
outcomesDescription = Please enter your outcome variables in the table below.  \
Outcomes are the dependent variables in your study.  For example, in a study investigating \
cholesterol-lowering medication, the outcome could be serum cholesterol levels.<p></p> \
If the set of measurements is repeated over time, enter the outcomes once in the table \
and then select the number of repetitions from the drop down list.  For example, if a \
researcher measured cholesterol at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after treatment, \
you would enter 'cholesterol' as your outcome, and select 3 repetitions.
outcomesLabelRepeated = Number of measurement repetitions:
