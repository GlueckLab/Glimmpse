<p> \
If you have a rough idea of the number of research participants you will be able to recruit, then solving for power may be more beneficial. <p>\
If you have fewer restrictions on recruitment and would like to ensure a well-powered study, then solving for sample size \
is likely to be more useful.

solvingForSampleSizeLabel = Total Sample Size
solvingForEffectSizeLabel = Effect Size
solvingForNominalPowerTitle = Power Values
solvingForNominalPowerDescription = Enter the desired power values in the list below. \

 the null hypothesis.  Common  values are 0.8 or 0.9.  <p>Type each value into the listbox and click "Add". \
 To remove an item, highlight the value and click the "Delete" button.

that will be observed in your study. <p></p>You will be asked to enter the names of your \
outcomes, and indicate whether the measurements were repeated on individual \
subjects.
# outcomes panel

over multiple days)
repeatedMeasuresRepeatsLabel = How many times?
repeatedMeasuresUnitsLabel = Over what dimension?
# predictors panel
predictorsTitle = Study Groups
predictorsDescription = Here you will specify the characteristics of subjects in your study.  This will help define the \
groups involved in your study.
categoricalTitle = Categorical Predictors
categoricalDescription = In the table below, specify any categorical predictors.  Categorical predictors take on \
a set number of possible values (i.e. categories).  A common example of a categorical predictor is treatment group, \
where research participants may be randomized to a placebo or an active drug group.  \
 <p> \
 Enter the names of all categorical predictors in the left text box.  For example, one might enter "drug" and "gender" as predictors. \
 </p><p> \
For each predictor, highlight the predictor name from the list on the left below the "Predictor" text box, \
and type its associated category names in the "Categories" text box.<p> \
For the example above, you would highlight "drug", then enter "placebo" and "active" as categories.  Next, you would \
highlight "gender" and type "male" and "female" as categories.
covariateTitle = Controlling for a Single Gaussian Predictor
covariateDescription = A common experimental design is analysis of covariance.  Analysis of covariance \
includes one or more fixed predictors. For example, one might run an experiment with 10 males and \
10 females, with an indicator variable for gender as a fixed predictor.  In addition, the design typically includes \
a single Gaussian predictor.  \
<p> \
A common special case of analysis of covariance is the baseline covariate design.  In such a design, a scientist \
records a series of repeated measurements on a continuous outcome.  The first one is measured at the start of \
the experiment and is commonly called the baseline covariate.  The other repeated measurements are used \
as outcomes in the general linear multivariate model.  A baseline covariate often explains \
a useful proportion of the variance of outcomes, thus increasing the \
power for the hypotheses of interest. \
<p>\
GLIMMPSE can calculate power for hypotheses concerning the fixed predictors, \
optionally controlling for a single Gaussian predictor.  If you plan to include a single \
Guassian predictor in your model, click the check box below.\
<p> \
At present, the GLIMMPSE software does not calculate power for multiple Gaussian predictors nor \
non-normally distributed predictors.
predictorsTableColumn = Predictor
categoriesTableColumn = Category

predictorsCovariateDescription = Finally, you can control for a subject characteristic which does not have a predefined set of \
values, also known as a baseline covariate.  This could includes values such as age, height, systolic blood pressure, etc.  \
To control for a baseline covariate, name your covariate below.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal distribution, \
so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.
matrixCovariateDescription = You may control for a single baseline covariate by clicking the checkbox below, \
and specifying a mean and standard deviation for the variable.  The covariate is assumed to follow a normal \
distribution

If your group sizes are equal, specify the number of study participants within each group.  For unequal group sizes, \
specify the number of study participants in the smallest group. \
<p> \
In many cases, it is not possible to know the exact number of participants that will be recruited for a study. \
Therefore, you may calculate power for several possible values for the per group sample size.  If you are unsure of \
the exact number of participants in each group, a reasonable approach would be calculate power for your target \
per group sample size, as well as half and twice that value. \
<p> \
Enter the per group sample sizes in the text box below and click enter.  To \
remove a per group sample size from the list, highlight it and click the "Delete" button.
perGroupSampleSizeTableColumn = Per Group Sample Size

For equal group sizes, select a "1" in the drop-down list next to each study group.  This is the default study design. \
<p> \
For unequal group sizes, you will specify the ratio of the group sizes.  For example, consider a design with \
an active drug group and a placebo group.  If twice as many study participants \
receive the placebo, you would select "2" for the placebo group, and "1" for the active drug group.
relativeGroupSizeTableColumn = Relative<br>Group Size

one factors changes based on levels of a second factor.  For example, if a hypertension medication lowers systolic blood pressure by \
20 mmHg in males, but only 5 mmHg in females when compared against a placebo group, then the magnitude of the interaction \
effect would be 15 mmHg.  <p></p>In the text boxes below, enter the minimum "difference of differences" you would like to be able to detect \
for each of your outcomes.  That is, enter the amount by which you expect the effect of

for half and twice the estimated mean differences you specified on the previous screen.

explains some portion of the variance in the outcome.  The &Sigma;<sub>YG</sub>matrix defines the \
strength of the association between the covariate and the outcomes.  \
For univariate designs, &Sigma;<sub>YG</sub> will be a 1x1 matrix containing the covariance \
