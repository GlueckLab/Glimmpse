would be listed in the outcomes table above, and "week" with 3 repetitions would be entered \
in the repeated measures table.  If the study took 2  SBP measurements at each week, you \

so you will need to estimate the mean (average) and standard deviation for your variable.

to include in your calculations.  For equal group sizes, the total subjects in the study will be the per group sample \
size times the number of groups.  For unequal sizes, the total sample size will be calculated as the sum of \
the relative groups sizes times the per group size.  For example, in the study with treatments A, B, C and \
twice the subjects in group A, a per group size of 10 would yield 20 subjects in group A, 10 in C, and 10 in B \
(total sample size of 40)

twice the subjects in group A, you would select 2 for A, 1 for B, and 1 for C
